COM=>(Component object Model)

Com Architecture

1.Encapsulation
=> Objects expose functionality via intefaces rather than implementation details

2.language independence
=> Com objects can be created in one language and used in another
3. Interoperability
=> Com enables communication between softwarer components across differnet processes and machines
4. Binary standard
=>Unlike tradational header files, COM interfaces are defined in a binary format ensuring compatibility across compiliers

COM INterface and class

1.QueryInterface()=> used to obtain pointers to other interfaces
2.AddRef()=> Increase the refence count of the object
3.Release()=> Descrese the refernce count and destroys the object with no refernce 

interface IMyInterface:public IUnkown{
	virtual HRESULT STDMETHODCALLTYPE DOsomething=0;
	
}
